          Journalism and Criminology Double Major at the University of Maryland
        </div>

          <div class="top">
              I'm Barbara, a senior at the University of Maryland-College Park and I'm  pursuing a double major in Journalism and Criminology with a French minor. When I finish school I wish to work for a local TV station covering the local news that are at the core of our communities, and start to build my way up to be a national news correspondent. I would like to combine my criminology major with my future broadcast job by focusing on stories of people who have been impacted by crime, specifically victims of sex crimes and child abuse. My main passions include reading, figure skating, painting and fostering puppies in my spare time.

Another responsibility was working as a cameraperson and smoothly transitioned camera angles and frames when asked, and as planned on the rundown. Worked closely with producers and reporters when reporting on location.
